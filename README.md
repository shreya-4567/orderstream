# OrderStream

**OrderStream** is a real-time full-stack **Order Management System** designed to handle customer orders with AWS integrations and a complete CI/CD pipeline.

---

## Project Overview

This project aims to build and deploy a scalable, modern Order Management System using:

- **Frontend**: React.js (with Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI)
- **Backend**: Node.js (or Spring Boot)
- **Cloud Services**: AWS DynamoDB, S3, SNS
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions / Jenkins

---

## Objectives

- Create, store, and manage customer orders
- Upload and access invoices through S3
- Notify users via SNS on order creation
- Clean, responsive UI for interacting with orders
- End-to-end CI/CD for continuous deployment

---

## Backend (Node.js / Spring Boot)

### Entities

- `Order`
  - `orderId` (UUID)
  - `customerName` (String)
  - `orderAmount` (Double)
  - `orderDate` (ISO Timestamp)
  - `invoiceFileUrl` (String, S3 URL)

### Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint        | Description                          |
|--------|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/orders`        | Create a new order (upload invoice to S3, send SNS) |
| GET    | `/orders/{id}`   | Fetch order by ID                    |
| GET    | `/orders`        | List all orders                      |

### AWS Integration

- **DynamoDB**: Store order data
- **S3**: Upload and retrieve invoice PDFs
- **SNS**: Send notifications on new order creation

---

## Frontend (React.js)

   - Upload invoice (PDF)
   - POST to `/orders`

3. **Order Detail** (`/orders/:id`)
   - Detailed view of a single order
   - Download invoice button

### UI Features

- Responsive design
- Toast notifications
- Styled using Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI
